# Shopify JSON Responses

Not all Shopify resources has `*.json` endpoints readily available. i.e. search results, 
blog articles.  To solve this, we'll use alternate templates to build our own JSON objects.

This repo uses Shopify's free [Boundless theme](https://themes.shopify.com/themes/boundless/) 
for its examples.
